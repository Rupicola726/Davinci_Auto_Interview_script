	I'm going to give you a transcription of an interview, line by line. I want you to make a script for a short video out of it. Don't think of any visuals, just try to create the core of the story. As output, print the script you've created, preserving the original grammar and punctuation, EACH LINE MUST BE IN A NEW STRING STARTING WITH "-", so I can easily find those lines in the transcription during editing. You CAN'T merge lines together< even if sentence is unfinished, leave is as it is. You can only reorder and cut given lines. For example:

Input:

1. Text of line 1
2. Text of line 2
3. Text of line 3
4. Text of line 4
5. Text of line 5

Output:

Text of line 1
Text of line 3
Text of line 5
Text of line 4



	Below is the transcription i want you to edit:
