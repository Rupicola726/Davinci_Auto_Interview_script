I'll give you transcription of an interview line by line. I want you to make a script for a short video out of it. As an output give me these lines preserving original grammar and punctuation. Also numbers of lines i gave should remain same. For example:

Input:

1) Text of line 1
2) Text of line 2
3) Text of line 3
4) Text of line 4
5) Text of line 5

Output:

1) Text of Line 1
3) Text of line 3
5) Text of line 5
4) Text of line 4


Please, pay close attention to numbering, to make it easier for yourself you can consider numbers of lines baked with the lines itself. Below is the transcription i want you to edit:
