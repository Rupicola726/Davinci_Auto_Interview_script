- Why you choose the
- broadcast solution? Why?
- Oh, that was a long process.
- Out of all the companies that connected
- the four ideas, these ones were more
- professional in just their response.
- We went through a very rigorous process
- of a couple of months of getting the
- solution, talking to them and then why
- broadcast solutions?
- Very important point because they are the
- glue basically, they're the builders.
- It's not about OK, even I could have gone
- to the market and buy all this stuff and
- then start building it.
- But they have the team around the right
- people who will not make
- the mistakes on the wiring.
- They will. I told them that this is a
- this is a partnership.
- It's not just that, oh, I am the client.
- I demand this to happen. That's not how
- it works in technology.
- It needs to be the right thing, right way
- to do it, not my way to do it.
- It should be the correct way. So we went
- through a couple of players.
- One of the players just disappeared and
- the second player was
- like, no, wishy washy.
- We were like trying to.
- He's always agreeing on everything that
- we ask and no technical
- specification under it.
- So nothing really seemed
- to be real at this point.
- So every every conversation will end up.
- Yeah, we can do that. But can you really?
- So broadcast solutions were the guys who
- literally sat with us
- and explained step by step.
- How is it going to work? What do we need
- for it? And can it be made or not?
- Can it happen? And the main thing with
- broadcast solutions from day one, they
- responded to our email on time.
- And every meeting, every response was on
- time, never delayed.
- Everything was on the dot.
- Being like a professional here, according
- to my little experience here in Dubai is
- a pretty rare thing.
- So usually it's just like, yeah, yeah,
- this and that. They forgot like in a
- month, they responded.
- And just again, the quotation is
- different. Everything is different.
- Everything is different. Oh, I forgot to
- do that. So
- everything's like mass, very messy.
- But with broadcast solutions, it was
- pretty like everything
- was clear from the start.
- Yeah, no double talk,
- nothing always on time.
- It was the deliverable.
- So we've met a new MEP guy today. We've
- shown him the place for our...
- Yeah, Aditya. We've shown
- him the place for our train.
- Still can be an issue. They just don't
- want to give us the space for the water,
- for the drinking water.
- They just want us to use the bottles. But
- we'll try to, you know, battle them.
- Also, finally, I guess and I hope that
- Manchini will cover the
- part of the design thing.
- Because I have nobody
- left. Everybody is busy.
- Design for the studio. The
- wall, the back wall design.
- So they take into
- consideration what kind of a screen.
- Isn't that mostly treatment?
- Yeah, it's mostly treatment. But anyway,
- it should look good.
- We covered in the meeting very important
- things. The biggest one was the FCU.
- The noise level should be controlled,
- thoroughly controlled.
- It was the biggest pain
- point, highest priority point.
- We lost one FCU on the
- drawings. Now it's bad.
- Yeah, so they had a wrong thing. It was
- incomplete. They were short on that.
- That was the biggest
- point that's covered.
- We went through the samples he gave us to
- decide on the material
- design, whatever it's going to be.
- And the shape is obviously dependent on
- the curve of the wall. It is what it is.
- They will squeeze as much desk that's
- possible in that space.
- And of course, we are having some kind of
- a soft argument about
- green on green, green on.
- I want bright, vivid colors. I don't want
- the place to look like a regular office
- with dull, subdued colors.
- It needs to pop. Business doesn't need to
- be dull. Business can be health,
- vibrancy, natural
- colors, green, all of that.
- Shouldn't be boring.
- Shouldn't be boring. We are not boring.
- We're going to make business fun and
- entertaining and useful.
- It's day to day, you know, like business
- is fun. Business is
- life. Everything is business.
- And then another thing, they're going to
- try to put in another rack by the way.
- I told them that can you
- squeeze in like a split rack.
- Is it going to be the 47?
- No, no, there's not enough space. So they
- are going to look for a low profile rack
- to squeeze somehow as a man.
- Let's not waste. They said we put it on
- our wheels because the last time he
- showed me all of that stuff, it was
- looking pretty full.
- So we told what we told broadcast
- solutions that make the desk a storage
- desk basically like, you know, we're not
- using it like like an extra storage space
- because it's a very big desk.
- Dense desk effectively and can be just
- why not just put compartments everywhere,
- boxes everywhere you can have it.
- It's going to be off air anyway. It's not
- going to be on camera shots. That's that.
- Here, man. Hope it wasn't too boring.
- It's all right.
- Just realize that it's not boring to
- someone who cares about.
