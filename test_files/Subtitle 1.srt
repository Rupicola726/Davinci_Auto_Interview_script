1
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,103
<b>So we've met a new MEP guy today. We've</b>

2
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,563
<b>shown him the place for our...</b>

3
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:08,855
<b>Aditya.</b>

4
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,232
<b>Yeah, Aditya. We've shown</b>

5
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,026
<b>him the place for our train.</b>

6
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,029
<b>Still can be an issue. They just don't</b>

7
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,324
<b>want to give us the space for the water,</b>

8
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,117
<b>for the drinking water.</b>

9
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,786
<b>They just want us to use the bottles. But</b>

10
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,414
<b>we'll try to, you know, battle them.</b>

11
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,126
<b>Also, finally, I guess and I hope that</b>

12
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,294
<b>Manchini will cover the</b>

13
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,004
<b>part of the design thing.</b>

14
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,339
<b>Because I have nobody</b>

15
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,673
<b>left. Everybody is busy.</b>

16
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:35,965
<b>Which design?</b>

17
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,467
<b>Design for the studio. The</b>

18
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,593
<b>wall, the back wall design.</b>

19
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,179
<b>So they take into</b>

20
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,431
<b>consideration what kind of a screen.</b>

21
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,515
<b>Isn't that mostly treatment?</b>

22
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,601
<b>Yeah, it's mostly treatment. But anyway,</b>

23
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,185
<b>it should look good.</b>

24
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:49,645
<b>We covered in the meeting very important</b>

25
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,564
<b>things. The biggest one was the FCU.</b>

26
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,649
<b>The noise level should be controlled,</b>

27
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,567
<b>thoroughly controlled.</b>

28
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,319
<b>It was the biggest pain</b>

29
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,445
<b>point, highest priority point.</b>

30
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,989
<b>We lost one FCU on the</b>

31
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,491
<b>drawings. Now it's bad.</b>

32
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,159
<b>Yeah, so they had a wrong thing. It was</b>

33
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,244
<b>incomplete. They were short on that.</b>

34
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:05,870
<b>That was the biggest</b>

35
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,746
<b>point that's covered.</b>

36
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:07,955
<b>A variant.</b>

37
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:11,084
<b>We went through the samples he gave us to</b>

38
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,460
<b>decide on the material</b>

39
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,753
<b>design, whatever it's going to be.</b>

40
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,255
<b>And the shape is obviously dependent on</b>

41
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,257
<b>the curve of the wall. It is what it is.</b>

42
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,010
<b>They will squeeze as much desk that's</b>

43
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,719
<b>possible in that space.</b>

44
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,430
<b>I told them to get brushed metal legs by</b>

45
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,264
<b>the way. They look nice.</b>

46
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,643
<b>Brushed metal, like this, kind of. Grey,</b>

47
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,728
<b>brushed metal. Looks very nice.</b>

48
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,438
<b>We have black. They said no problem.</b>

49
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,439
<b>That's not an issue.</b>

50
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,401
<b>And the other thing is that we told them</b>

51
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,819
<b>carpet wise, super</b>

52
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:41,239
<b>thick carpet in the studio.</b>

53
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,448
<b>And then maybe less thick</b>

54
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,283
<b>in the general office area.</b>

55
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,954
<b>And of course, we are having some kind of</b>

56
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,414
<b>a soft argument about</b>

57
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,624
<b>green on green, green on.</b>

58
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,334
<b>I want bright, vivid colors. I don't want</b>

59
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,379
<b>the place to look like a regular office</b>

60
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,256
<b>with dull, subdued colors.</b>

61
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,217
<b>It needs to pop. Business doesn't need to</b>

62
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,761
<b>be dull. Business can be health,</b>

63
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,763
<b>vibrancy, natural</b>

64
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,140
<b>colors, green, all of that.</b>

65
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,057
<b>Shouldn't be boring.</b>

66
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,642
<b>Shouldn't be boring. We are not boring.</b>

67
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,436
<b>We're going to make business fun and</b>

68
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,687
<b>entertaining and useful.</b>

69
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:15,356
<b>It's day to day, you know, like business</b>

70
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,483
<b>is fun. Business is</b>

71
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,526
<b>life. Everything is business.</b>

72
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,613
<b>And then another thing, they're going to</b>

73
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,407
<b>try to put in another rack by the way.</b>

74
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,241
<b>I told them that can you</b>

75
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,951
<b>squeeze in like a split rack.</b>

76
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:29,328
<b>Is it going to be the 47?</b>

77
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,247
<b>No, no, there's not enough space. So they</b>

78
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,207
<b>are going to look for a low profile rack</b>

79
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,042
<b>to squeeze somehow as a man.</b>

80
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,711
<b>Let's not waste. They said we put it on</b>

81
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,005
<b>our wheels because the last time he</b>

82
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,214
<b>showed me all of that stuff, it was</b>

83
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:40,965
<b>looking pretty full.</b>

84
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,760
<b>And then having like a like they will</b>

85
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,637
<b>move the non-movable stuff</b>

86
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,930
<b>in that rack split the gear.</b>

87
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:51,058
<b>So for because otherwise we will be like</b>

88
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,018
<b>you remember we have an</b>

89
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,311
<b>idea to have something.</b>

90
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:56,898
<b>We need the desk. Yes.</b>

91
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,816
<b>Of the equipment, right. Not generate</b>

92
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,942
<b>that much of a sound.</b>

93
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,528
<b>So we told what we told broadcast</b>

94
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:04,906
<b>solutions that make the desk a storage</b>

95
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,074
<b>desk basically like, you know, we're not</b>

96
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,951
<b>using it like like an extra storage space</b>

97
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,453
<b>because it's a very big desk.</b>

98
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,623
<b>Dense desk effectively and can be just</b>

99
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,583
<b>why not just put compartments everywhere,</b>

100
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:17,043
<b>boxes everywhere you can have it.</b>

101
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,503
<b>It's going to be off air anyway. It's not</b>

102
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,838
<b>going to be on camera shots. That's that.</b>

103
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,132
<b>Why you choose the</b>

104
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,884
<b>broadcast solution? Why?</b>

105
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,220
<b>Oh, that was a long process.</b>

106
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,682
<b>Out of all the companies that connected</b>

107
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:35,770
<b>the four ideas, these ones were more</b>

108
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,689
<b>professional in just their response.</b>

109
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,317
<b>We went through a very rigorous process</b>

110
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,278
<b>of a couple of months of getting the</b>

111
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,656
<b>solution, talking to them and then why</b>

112
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,365
<b>broadcast solutions?</b>

113
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,534
<b>Very important point because they are the</b>

114
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,911
<b>glue basically, they're the builders.</b>

115
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,247
<b>It's not about OK, even I could have gone</b>

116
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,957
<b>to the market and buy all this stuff and</b>

117
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,083
<b>then start building it.</b>

118
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,168
<b>But they have the team around the right</b>

119
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,127
<b>people who will not make</b>

120
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,087
<b>the mistakes on the wiring.</b>

121
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,589
<b>They will. I told them that this is a</b>

122
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,423
<b>this is a partnership.</b>

123
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,634
<b>It's not just that, oh, I am the client.</b>

124
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,844
<b>I demand this to happen. That's not how</b>

125
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:09,554
<b>it works in technology.</b>

126
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,056
<b>It needs to be the right thing, right way</b>

127
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,891
<b>to do it, not my way to do it.</b>

128
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,644
<b>It should be the correct way. So we went</b>

129
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,853
<b>through a couple of players.</b>

130
01:04:17,853 --> 01:04:20,147
<b>One of the players just disappeared and</b>

131
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,899
<b>the second player was</b>

132
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,402
<b>like, no, wishy washy.</b>

133
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,695
<b>We were like trying to.</b>

134
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,364
<b>He's always agreeing on everything that</b>

135
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,575
<b>we ask and no technical</b>

136
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,118
<b>specification under it.</b>

137
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,079
<b>So nothing really seemed</b>

138
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,914
<b>to be real at this point.</b>

139
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,292
<b>So every every conversation will end up.</b>

140
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,086
<b>Yeah, we can do that. But can you really?</b>

141
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,922
<b>So broadcast solutions were the guys who</b>

142
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,299
<b>literally sat with us</b>

143
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,551
<b>and explained step by step.</b>

144
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,469
<b>How is it going to work? What do we need</b>

145
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,723
<b>for it? And can it be made or not?</b>

146
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,892
<b>Can it happen? And the main thing with</b>

147
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:58,686
<b>broadcast solutions from day one, they</b>

148
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,146
<b>responded to our email on time.</b>

149
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,399
<b>And every meeting, every response was on</b>

150
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,026
<b>time, never delayed.</b>

151
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:08,404
<b>Everything was on the dot. And it was</b>

152
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,990
<b>even then, even when we had the win</b>

153
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:11,782
<b>media, which is our</b>

154
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:12,908
<b>main automation solution,</b>

155
01:05:12,908 --> 01:05:13,993
<b>they didn't understand how to do the</b>

156
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,288
<b>presentation with our account manager,</b>

157
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,706
<b>product account owner, Lauren.</b>

158
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,250
<b>He explained to them that I was just</b>

159
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,294
<b>asking them to do a day in the life of a</b>

160
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,296
<b>station, not a training video.</b>

161
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,422
<b>Everyone was trying to do a training</b>

162
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,008
<b>video. So let's do a train like a day in</b>

163
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:29,884
<b>the life of a station.</b>

164
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,802
<b>Being like a professional here, according</b>

165
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,598
<b>to my little experience here in Dubai is</b>

166
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,807
<b>a pretty rare thing.</b>

167
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,559
<b>So usually it's just like, yeah, yeah,</b>

168
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,436
<b>this and that. They forgot like in a</b>

169
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,145
<b>month, they responded.</b>

170
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,272
<b>And just again, the quotation is</b>

171
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:43,689
<b>different. Everything is different.</b>

172
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,358
<b>Everything is different. Oh, I forgot to</b>

173
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,734
<b>do that. So</b>

174
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,028
<b>everything's like mass, very messy.</b>

175
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,113
<b>But with broadcast solutions, it was</b>

176
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,281
<b>pretty like everything</b>

177
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,075
<b>was clear from the start.</b>

178
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:55,660
