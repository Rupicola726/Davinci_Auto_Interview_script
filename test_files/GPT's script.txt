- We121-4751X4779 -- Why you choose the
- by128-4779X4821 -- broadcast solution? Why?
- Os133-4848X4877 -- Oh, that was a long process.
- Od145-4889X4984 -- Out of all the companies that connected
- te143-4984X5082 -- the four ideas, these ones were more
- pe144-5082X5152 -- professional in just their response.
- Ws148-5153X5215 -- We went through a very rigorous process
- oe146-5215X5286 -- of a couple of months of getting the
- sy149-5286X5343 -- solution, talking to them and then why
- bs132-5343X5360 -- broadcast solutions?
- Ve154-5366X5411 -- Very important point because they are the
- gs151-5411X5468 -- glue basically, they're the builders.
- Ie156-5481X5524 -- It's not about OK, even I could have gone
- td156-5524X5565 -- to the market and buy all this stuff and
- tt140-5565X5592 -- then start building it.
- Bt157-5592X5642 -- But they have the team around the right
- pe143-5642X5665 -- people who will not make
- tg147-5665X5688 -- the mistakes on the wiring.
- Ta158-5695X5748 -- They will. I told them that this is a
- tp144-5748X5768 -- this is a partnership.
- It163-5777X5821 -- It's not just that, oh, I am the client.
- Iw163-5829X5874 -- I demand this to happen. That's not how
- iy148-5874X5891 -- it works in technology.
- Iy167-5905X5951 -- It needs to be the right thing, right way
- tt157-5951X5995 -- to do it, not my way to do it.
- It168-5995X6061 -- It should be the correct way. So we went
- ts157-6061X6090 -- through a couple of players.
- Od169-6090X6145 -- One of the players just disappeared and
- ts152-6145X6187 -- the second player was
- ly154-6187X6247 -- like, no, wishy washy.
- Ht173-6279X6342 -- He's always agreeing on everything that
- wl158-6342X6395 -- we ask and no technical
- st159-6395X6431 -- specification under it.
- Sd161-6436X6502 -- So nothing really seemed
- tt163-6502X6546 -- to be real at this point.
- Yy181-6603X6670 -- Yeah, we can do that. But can you really?
- So181-6681X6738 -- So broadcast solutions were the guys who
- ls163-6738X6771 -- literally sat with us
- ap170-6771X6825 -- and explained step by step.
- Hd184-6825X6871 -- How is it going to work? What do we need
- ft179-6871X6949 -- for it? And can it be made or not?
- Ch184-6949X7025 -- Can it happen? And the main thing with
- by185-7025X7068 -- broadcast solutions from day one, they
- re179-7068X7103 -- responded to our email on time.
- An189-7110X7181 -- And every meeting, every response was on
- td170-7181X7220 -- time, never delayed.
- Es188-7235X7301 -- Everything was on the dot. And it was
- en187-7301X7363 -- even then, even when we had the win
- mr172-7363X7381 -- media, which is our
- mn179-7381X7408 -- main automation solution,
- Bs211-8285X8324 -- But with broadcast solutions, it was
- pg198-8324X8352 -- pretty like everything
- wt202-8352X8394 -- was clear from the start.
- Yk199-8410X8432 -- Yeah, no double talk,
- ne202-8439X8481 -- nothing always on time.
- In221-8496X8574 -- It was the deliverable. Even the way even
- te203-8574X8595 -- then we didn't have we
- dy208-8595X8618 -- didn't pay them any money.
- TK223-8633X8699 -- They're the quality of responses was OK,
- Ie205-8699X8719 -- I'm going to be late.
- Ie206-8719X8737 -- I'm going to be late.
- Ee226-8737X8766 -- Even if it's few minutes, you know, like
- ye227-8766X8804 -- you see all of those things, we realize,
- Ot220-8804X8833 -- OK, in a project, you need that.
- Od204-8841X8864 -- OK, we're good.
- Hg227-8877X8921 -- Here, man. Hope it wasn't too boring.
- It206-8942X8953 -- It's all right.
- Jo228-8976X9034 -- Just realize that it's not boring to
- st217-9034X9055 -- someone who cares about.
